# Interactive Landing Page

This project made due to my Udacity course in Nanodegree, Front-End Web Developmer. This is an interactive Landing Page where each section gets the active class when it's displayed on viewport.
So, That includes dynamic creation of nav items depending on how many sections there are, slide to section on click, hiding sticky header, collapsable sections, & thoughtful design regarding the modern standrads
